## Libraries Used
- Keith Horwood's audiosynth for live playback:
https://keithwhor.github.io/audiosynth/

- Verovio JS Toolkit for rendering input notes: 
https://github.com/rism-ch/verovio

- MIDI Player for playback of transcribed notes: 
https://github.com/rism-ch/midi-player


## Inspiration
- Anna Neovesky & Gabriel Reimers' pianoKeyboard, which transcribes using Verovio:

## Future Work
- [ ] Sometime soon, I hope to make it simple to embed and create more comprehensive settings for it.
- [ ] Convert to Humdrum Verovio notaion https://verovio.humdrum.org/. This will require comprehensive rewriting, but would permit for multiple voices (chords that are made up of notes of different durations). An intuitive input method for this is not yet clear -- one option is to quantize live input through a virtual & interactive metronome.
